# SimPer: Simple Self-Supervised Learning of Periodic Targets paper reproduction
This repository was created as part of an assignment for Georgia Tech's OMSCS course CSE 6250: Big Data for Health Informatics. For more information, visit: CSE 6250: Big Data for Health Informatics
We attempted to replicate the Original Paper using PyTorch. We will conduct the learning of Periodic features using the SimPer Framework, targeting the Rotating Digits dataset.
